# Flux - A Multi-Platform Version Control System

## 📌 Overview
Flux is a lightweight, file-based version control system that allows users to track changes, commit files, and push to various remote storage platforms such as Google Drive, Mega, or any custom storage provider. Unlike Git, which primarily works with repositories hosted on platforms like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, Flux is designed for **multi-platform** flexibility, enabling users to manage version control across different cloud and local storage solutions.

## 🚀 Vision & Goals
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Push and pull versions from cloud storage services like Google Drive, Mega, Dropbox, or even personal servers.
- **Decentralized VCS**: No reliance on a single hosting provider—users can configure their own remotes.
- **Lightweight & Simple**: Unlike Git, which is designed for large-scale software development, Flux will focus on a minimalistic, user-friendly approach.
- **Offline First**: Fully functional local versioning even without an internet connection.

## 🏗️ Development Plan
Flux is structured into multiple phases to ensure a smooth and systematic implementation.

### **Phase 1: Core Local Version Control System (Planned)**
- Implement a local repository structure (`.flux/` directory)
- Track file changes using hashing techniques
- Implement basic commit functionality
- Store metadata for version history
- Allow rollback to previous commits

### **Phase 2: Branching & Merging System (Planned)**
- Implement branching functionality
- Enable switching between different versions/branches
- Merge changes with conflict detection and resolution

### **Phase 3: Multi-Platform Remote Storage Support (Planned)**
- Develop a remote system where users can configure different storage backends
- Support Google Drive, Mega, Dropbox, or custom storage services
- Implement `flux push` and `flux pull` commands
- Enable authentication for different remote services

### **Phase 4: Optimization & Advanced Features (Planned)**
- Optimize storage for efficiency and scalability
- Implement better conflict resolution strategies
- Introduce a plugin system for extending functionality

## 🛠️ Core Concepts
1. **Tracking & Commits**: Instead of storing full copies of files, Flux will store incremental changes.
2. **Branching**: Users will be able to maintain multiple versions of their files.
3. **Remote Storage**: Flux will allow pushing to and pulling from different platforms seamlessly.
4. **Conflict Handling**: A mechanism to handle conflicts when merging different file versions.

## 📖 Planned CLI Commands
```
flux init            # Initialize a new Flux repository
flux add <file>      # Track a file
flux commit -m "msg" # Commit changes
flux log             # View commit history
flux checkout <id>   # Restore a previous version
flux remote add <name> <url>  # Add a remote
flux push <name>     # Push to remote storage
flux pull <name>     # Pull latest changes from a remote
```

## 💻 Getting Started (Once Implemented)
1. Install Flux (to be implemented as a Python package)
2. Run `flux init` in a directory to start tracking
3. Add files using `flux add`
4. Commit changes using `flux commit`
5. Set up a remote using `flux remote add`
6. Push changes using `flux push`
